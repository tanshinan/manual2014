He's back, and he's got a new trick,\\
Magical Trevor is ten times as slick\\
As the last time,\\
The last time you saw him,\\
Now you can see why we really adore him,\par
\vspace{10pt}
You might think, his new trick is sick,\\
Sawing a pigeon in half with a stick,\\
Look at the pigeon, now it's in two,\\
Oh my it's rear end is having a poo,\par
\vspace{10pt}
Look at the mess, in aisle 2,\\
Aisle 2,\\
That's the place where we saw the ragu,\\
Theres so much ragu.
