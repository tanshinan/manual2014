\textbf{
I'm a lumberjack\\
And I'm O.K\\
I sleep all night\\
And I work all day\\
}
\\
He's a lumberjack\\
And he's O.K\\
He sleeps all night\\
And he works all day\\
\\
\textbf{
I cut down trees'\\
I eat my lunch\\
I go to the lavatory\\
On Wednesdays I go shopping\\
And have buttered scones for tea\\
}
\\
He cuts down trees\\
He eats his lunch\\
He goes to the lavatory\\
On Wednesdays he goes shopping\\
And has buttered scones for tea\\
\\
He's a lumberjack...\\
\\
\textbf{
I cut down trees\\
I skip and jump\\
I like to press wild flowers\\
I put on women's clothing\\
And hang around in bars\\
}
\\
He cuts down trees\\
He skips and jumps\\
He likes to press wild flowers\\
He puts on women's clothing\\
And hangs around in bars\\
\\
He's a lumberjack...\\
\\
\textbf{
I cut down trees\\
I wear high heels\\
Suspenders and a bra\\
I wish I'd been a girlie\\
Just like my dear mama.\\
}
\\
He cuts down trees\\
He wears high heels\\
(sägs hellre än sjungs) Suspenders ..... and a bra?\\
That's shocking.\\
\\
He's a lumberjack...
