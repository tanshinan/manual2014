Magical Trevor is here for the day,\\
We all love him, its safe to say.\\
It's 12 PM so he starts with a thriller,\\
He's gonna do tricks with a chinchilla.\par
\vspace{10pt}
Covers it up with his magical cloak,\\
Gets out some petrol and gives it a soak.\\
Look out kids, he's playing with matches,\\
He better be careful in case that cloak catches\par

On fire.\\
Oh no, the cloak is on fire.\par
\vspace{10pt}
Its turning to ashes with our furry friend,\\
When will this horror finally end?\\
Oh look its okay well that was amazin',\\
The chinchilla's just fine but now its turned into a raisin.\par
\vspace{10pt}
Shame no one's watching, put this in you journal.\\
Dear Diary, chinchillas sure are nocturnal.\\
Check up your animal facts next time Trevor\\
Ooh. You sure get nice coats at ``World of Leather''.
