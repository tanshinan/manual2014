There were four and twenty virgins\\
coming down from Inverness\\
And when the ball was over\\
there were four and twenty less.\\
\\
Swing your balls to your partner\\
and your arse against the wall.\\
If you never get fucked on a Saturday night\\
you never get fucked at all!\\
\\
The undertaker, he was there\\
Dressed in a long black shroud\\
Swingin' on the chandelier\\
an' pissin' on the crowd\\
\\
Swing your balls...\\
\\
There was fuckin' in the courtyard\\
there were fuckin' 'mong the ricks\\
you couldn't hear the music\\
for the swishing of the pricks\\
\\
Swing your balls...\\
\\
The ministers wife was there\\
she had us all in fits\\
jumping off the mantlepiece\\
bouncing on her tits\\
\\
Swing your balls...\\
\\
They were fuckin' in the bathrooms\\
they were fuckin' on the stairs\\
You couldn't see the carpet \\
for the cum and curly hairs\\
\\
Swing your balls...\\
\\
The bride was in her bower\\
explaining to the groom\\
The vagina, not the asshole\\
is the entrance to the womb\\
\\
Swing your balls...\\
\\
The queen was in the kitchen\\
eatin' bread and honey.\\
The king was in the kitchen maid\\
and she was in the money.\\
\\
Swing your balls...\\
\\
The village idiot he was there\\
sitting on a pole.\\
He his foreskin over his head\\
and whistled through the hole\\
\\
Swing your balls...\\
\\
Down in the square\\
the village dunce he stands\\
Amusing' himself by abusing' himself\\
and using both his hands\\
\\
Swing your balls...\\
\\
The postman, he was there\\
the poor man had the pox.\\
He couldn't fuck the lassies\\
so he fucked the letter box\\
\\
Swing your balls...\\
\\
It's the first lady forward,\\
and the second lady back\\
and the third lady's finger\\
in the fourth lady's crack.\\
\\
Swing your balls...\\
\\
The village granny she was there\\
doing her favourite stund\\
flippin' peanuts in the air\\
and catch them with her cunt\\
\\
Swing your balls...\\
\\
The village cripple was also there\\
he wasn't up to much\\
He lined the lassies against the wall\\
and fucked them with his crutch\\
\\
Swing your balls...\\
\\
There were fucking in the barley,\\
fucking in the oats.\\
Some were fuckin' sheep\\
but most were fuckin' goats\\
\\
Swing your balls...\\
\\
The village parson, he was there\\
and on the couch he sat\\
Thinking of pussy to get it hard\\
then ramming it into the cat.\\
\\
Swing your balls...\\
\\
And when the ball was over,\\
the opinion was expressed:\\
The music was exquisite but\\
the fuckin' was the best
