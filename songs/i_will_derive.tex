At first I was afraid, what could the answer be?\\
It said given this position find velocity.\\
So I tried to work it out,\\
but I knew that I was wrong.\\
I struggled; I cried,\\
``A problem shouldn't take this long!''\\
I tried to think, control my nerve.\\
It's evident that speed's tangential,\\
to that time-position curve.\\
This problem would be mine,\\
if I just knew that tangent line.\\
But what to do? Show me a sign!\par
\vspace{7pt}
So I thought back to Calculus.\\
Way back to Newton and to Leibniz,\\
And to problems just like this.\\
And just like that when I had given up all hope,\\
I said nope, there's just one way to find that slope.\\
And so now I, I will derive.\\
Find the derivative of x position with respect to time.\\
It's as easy as can be, just have to take dx/dt.\\
I will derive, I will derive. Hey, hey!\par
\newpage
And then I went ahead to the second part.\\
But as I looked at it I wasn't sure quite how to start.\\
It was asking for the time at which velocity\\
Was at a maximum, and I was thinking ``Woe is me.''\\
But then I thought, this much I know.\\
I've gotta find acceleration, set it equal to zero.\\
Now if I only knew what the function was for a.\\
I guess I'm gonna have to solve for it someway.\par

I will derive, I will derive.\par
