Hoarders can get piles of money,\\
That is true, hackers, that is true.\\
But they cannot help their neighbors;\\
That's not good, hackers, that's not good.\par

When we have enough free software\\
At our call, hackers, at our call,\\
We'll kick out those dirty licenses\\
Ever more, hackers, ever more.\par
