We've tried it once or twice\\
And found it rather nice\\
Roll me over lay me down and do it again\\
Roll me over in the clover, roll me over lay me down and do it again\\
\\
Oh this is number one \\
And the fun has just begun\\
Roll me over...\\
\\
Oh this is number two,\\
Down in front he's comin through\\
Roll me over...\\
\\
Oh this is number three\\
And his hand is on me knee\\
Roll me over...\\
\\
Oh this is number four\\
And he's been there twice before\\
Roll me over...\\
\\
Oh this is number five\\
I'm surprised I'm still alive\\
Roll me over...\\
\\
Oh this is number six,\\
And he's got me doin tricks\\
Roll me over...\\
\\
Well this is number seven,\\
And he took me straight to heaven\\
Roll me over...\\
\\
Oh this is number eight,\\
He bent me o'er the garden gate\\
Roll me over...\\
\\
Oh this is number nine,\\
And the baby's doin fine\\
Roll me over...\\
\\
Oh this is number ten,\\
And when he's through we'll do it again\\
Roll me over...\\
\\
Oh this is number eleven,\\
and I started again from seven\\
Roll me over...\\
\\
Oh this is number twelve,\\
and she said: ''Nu kan jag själv!´´\\
Roll me over...\\
\\
Oh this is number twenty,\\
and my gun is getting empty\\
Roll me over...\\
\\
Oh this is number thirty,\\
and this song is getting dirty\\
Roll me over...\\
\\
Oh this is number onethousandtwohundredandthirtyfour,\\
and she's crying out for more.\\
Roll me over...
