When I find myself in front of Windows,\\
Father Torvalds comes to me,\\
Speaking words of Linux, ``It is free!''.\\
And when hackers crack my system\\
through some strange NT obscurity,\\
he gives me the source-code, ``It is free!''.\par
\vspace{10pt}
It is free, it is free, it is free, it is free.\\
Linux is the answer, and it's free.\par
\vspace{10pt}
When the broken system crashes\\
and blue screens of death I see.\\
There is one true rescue, and it's free.\\
For though there may be doubts first\\
it will sure bring life to your PC\\
`Cause Linux is the answer, and it's free.\par
\vspace{10pt}
It is free, it is free, it is free, it is free,\\
You even get the source-code, it is free.\par
\vspace{10pt}
In the darkest night, when hacking,\\
Xfree stares right back at me,\\
Now I've installed Linux, I feel free.\\
No longer mad with my computer,\\
No more does it crash on me\\
Now I've installed Linux, it is free.
\newpage
It is free, it is free, it is free, it is free,\\
Open-sourced true power, it is free.\par
