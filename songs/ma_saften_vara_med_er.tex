Tell me Master Yoda, what is wrong with me?\\
Feels like I've been stepped on by a horse.\\
Could it be that I have drunk a galaxy\\
and underestimate the dark side of the Force?\par
\vspace{10pt}
Obi-Wan, Obi two, Obi three,\\
hit me with your laser drink.\\
Obi-Wan, Obi two, come and save me! \\
Down under the bar I sink.\par
\vspace{10pt}
Waking up next morning was a big ordeal,\\
thought I had a Leia in my bed,\\
but you can imagine, Master, how i feel\\
when I see Jabba lying there with me instead.\par
\vspace{10pt}
Obi-Wan, Obi two, Obi three,\\
warp me to another place.\\
Obi-Wan, Obi two, come and save me!\\
Throwing up in hyperspace.\par
\vspace{10pt}
Calm down now, young Skywalker, you will be fine,\\
R2D2 would have laughed at this.\\
Help me drink this bottle of Han Solo’s wine\\
and I will tell you who your mother really is.\par
\vspace{10pt}
Obi-Wan, Obi two, Obi three,\\
drink and you will fly alright\\
Obi-Wan, Obi two, come and save me!\\
Man, I had a Jedi night!
