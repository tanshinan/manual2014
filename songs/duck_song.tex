A duck walked up to a lemonade stand\\
And he said to the man, running the stand\\
``Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?''\\
The man said\\
``No, we just sell lemonade. But it's cold\\
And it's fresh\\
And it's all home-made. Can I get you\\
glass?''\\
The duck said,\\
``I'll pass.''\par

``No, like I said yesterday,\\
We just sell lemonade. OK?\\
Why not give it a try?''\\
The duck said,\\
``Goodbye.''

If you don't stay away, Duck,\\
I'll glue you to a tree and leave you there all day,\\

So don't get to close!''\\

And the man just stopped.\\
Then he started to smile.\\
He started to laugh.\\
He laughed for a while.\\
He said,\\
``Come on duck, let’s walk to the store.\\
I’ll buy you some grapes\\
So you won't have to ask anymore.''\\
So they walked to the store\\
And the man bought some grapes.\\
He gave one to the duck and the duck said,\\
``Hmm... No thanks. But you know what sounds good?\\
It would make my day.\\
Do you think this store...\\
Do you think this store...\\
Do you think this store... has any... lemonade?''\par
