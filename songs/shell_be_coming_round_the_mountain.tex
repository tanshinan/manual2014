She'll be coming 'round the mountain when she comes.\\
She'll be coming 'round the mountain when she comes.\\
She'll be coming 'round the mountain,\\
She'll be coming 'round the mountain,\\
She'll be coming 'round the mountain when she comes.\\
\\
Singing ay, ay, yippee, yippee, ay...\\
\\
She'll be drinking all the whiskey when she comes...\\
\\
She was wearing pink pyjamas when she came...\\
\\
She was wearing no pyjamas making love...\\
\\
She was wearing my pyjamas when she left...\\
\\
She will never, never be the same again...
