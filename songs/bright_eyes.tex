\fvisa{BRIGHT EYES}{Is it a kind of dream}

Is it a kind of dream,\\
Floating out on the tide,\\
Following the river of death downstream?\\
Oh, is it a dream?\par
\vspace{10pt}
There's a fog along the horizon,\\
A strange glow in the sky,\\
And nobody seems to know where you go,\\
And what does it mean?\\
Oh, is it a dream?\par
\vspace{10pt}
Bright eyes,\\
Burning like fire.\\
Bright eyes,\\
How can you close and fail?\\
How can the light that burned so brightly\\
Suddenly burn so pale?\\
Bright eyes.\par
\vspace{10pt}
Is it a kind of shadow,\\
Reaching into the night,\\
Wandering over the hills unseen,\\
Or is it a dream?\par
\vspace{10pt}
There's a high wind in the trees,\\
A cold sound in the air,\\
And nobody ever knows when you go,\\
And where do you start,\\
Oh, into the dark.\par
\vspace{10pt}
Bright eyes,\\
burning like fire.\\
Bright eyes,\\
how can you close and fail?\\
How can the light that burned so brightly\\
Suddenly burn so pale?\\
Bright eyes.\par
\vspace{10pt}
Bright eyes,\\
burning like fire.\\
Bright eyes,\\
how can you close and fail?\\
How can the light that burned so brightly\\
Suddenly burn so pale?\\
Bright eyes.
