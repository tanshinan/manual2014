One day, and I was itchin'\\
To fill up my belly\\

Of the best damn treat in the world\par

\textbf{Together:} I don't want a giant penis\\
Or a rocket ship to Venus\\
I don't want to win the lottery\\
I just want to squat and gobble\\
'Til I'm dizzy and I wobble\\
In a butter, fruit and dough tart dream\\
So I put butter on a Pop Tart\\
It was so freakin' good\\
