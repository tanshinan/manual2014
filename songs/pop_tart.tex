\textbf{Together:} Have you ever put butter on a Pop Tart?\\
It's so frickin' good\\
Have you ever put butter on a Pop Tart?\\
If you haven't then I think you should\\
\textbf{Peter:} I was sittin' in the kitchen\\
One day, and I was itchin'\\
To fill up my belly\\
With the pipin' hot jelly\\
Of the best damn treat in the world\\
\textbf{Quagmire:} He's talkin' Pop Tarts!\\
\textbf{Peter:} And I saw a stick of butter\\
And it almost made me shudder\\
And scream like a baby girl\\
\textbf{Together:} I don't want a giant penis\\
Or a rocket ship to Venus\\
I don't want to win the lottery\\
I just want to squat and gobble\\
'Til I'm dizzy and I wobble\\
In a butter, fruit and dough tart dream\\
So I put butter on a Pop Tart\\
It was so freakin' good\\
Have you ever put butter on a Pop Tart?\\
If you haven't then I think you should\\
\textbf{Quagmire:} Everybody come along with us!\\
\textbf{Together:} Have you ever put butter on a...\\
\textbf{Audience:} Pop Tart!\\
\textbf{Together:} It's so freakin' good\\
\textbf{Quagmire:} Yeah!\\
\textbf{Together:} Have you ever put butter on a...\\
\textbf{Audience:} Pop Tart!\\
\textbf{Together:} If you haven't then I think you should\\
\textbf{Quagmire:} Pop Tart!\\
\textbf{Peter:} With butter?!
