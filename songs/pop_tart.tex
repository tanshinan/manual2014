\vspace{10pt}
Have you ever put butter on a Pop Tart?\\
It's so frickin' good\\
Have you ever put butter on a Pop Tart?\\
If you haven't then I think you should\par
\vspace{10pt}
I was sittin' in the kitchen\\
One day, and I was itchin'\\
To fill up my belly\\
With the pipin' hot jelly\\
Of the best damn treat in the world\par
\vspace{10pt}
(He's talkin' Pop Tarts!)\par
\vspace{10pt}
And I saw a stick of butter\\
And it almost made me shudder\\
And scream like a baby girl\par
\vspace{10pt}
I don't want a giant penis\\
Or a rocket ship to Venus\\
I don't want to win the lottery\\
I just want to squat and gobble\\
'Til I'm dizzy and I wobble\\
In a butter, fruit and dough tart dream\\
So I put butter on a Pop Tart\\
It was so freakin' good\\
Have you ever put butter on a Pop Tart?\\
If you haven't then I think you should\par
