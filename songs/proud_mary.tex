\fvisa{PROUD MARY}{Left a good job in the city}
\vspace{10pt}
Left a good job in the city,\\
working for the Man ev'ry night and day,\\
and I never lost one minute of sleepin',\\
worryin' 'bout the way things might have been.\par
\vspace{10pt}
Big wheel keep on turnin',\\
Proud Mary keep on burnin',\\
rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river.\par
\vspace{10pt}
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis,\\
pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans,\\
but I never saw the good side of the city,\\
'til I hitched a ride on a riverboat queen\par
\vspace{10pt}
Big wheel, keep on turnin...\par
\vspace{10pt}
If you come down to the river,\\
bet you gonna find some people who live.\\
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money,\\
people on the river are happy to give.\par
\vspace{10pt}
Big wheel, keep on turnin...\\
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river.
\par
