\vspace{10pt}
When we get drunker, loosing our minds,\\
many beers from now.\\
Will we still be having us a real good time,\\
whiskey, gin and bottles of wine?\\
So fill up your glass now, get drunk as a skunk,\\
don't say you want no more.\\
We are the singers, we are the swingers\\
join us, you won't get bored!
