I know a fat old policeman\\
He's always on our street\\
A fat and jolly red-faced man\\
He really is a treat\par
\vspace{10pt}
He's too kind for a policeman\\
He's never known to frown\\
And everybody says\\
He is the happiest man in town!\par
\vspace{10pt}
(\textit{Laughter})\par
\vspace{10pt}
He laughs upon point duty\\
He laughs upon his beat\\
He laughs at everybody\\
When he's walking in the street\par
\vspace{10pt}
He never can stop laughing\\
He says he's never tried\\
But once he did arrest a man\\
And laughed until he cried!\par
\vspace{10pt}
(\textit{Laughter})\par
\vspace{10pt}
His jolly face is wrinkled\\
And then he shut his eyes\\
He opened his great big mouth\\
It was a wonderous size!\par
\vspace{10pt}
He said: ``I must arrest you!''\\
He didn't know what for\\
And then he started laughing\\
Until he cracked his jaw!\par
\vspace{10pt}
(\textit{Laughter})\par
\vspace{10pt}
So if you chance to meet him\\
While walking 'round the town\\
Shake him by his fat ol' hand\\
And give him half a crown\par
\vspace{10pt}
His eyes will beam and sparkle\\
He'll gurgle with delight\\
And then you'll start him laughing\\
With all his blessed might!
