I know a fat old policeman, he's always on our street\\
Fat jolly red-fasced man, he really is a treat\\
He's too kind for a policeman, he's never known to frown\\
And everybody says he is the happiest man in town.\par
\vspace{10pt}
He laughs upon point duty, he laughs upon his beat\\
He laughs at everybody while he's walking down the street\\
He never can stop laughing, he says he never tried\\
Well, once he did arrest a man, and laughed until he cried\par
\vspace{10pt}
He jolly face it wrinkled and then he shut his eyes\\
He opened his great mouth, it was a wondrous size\\
He said I must arrest you, but he didn't know what for\\
And then he started laughing until he cracked his jaw\par
\vspace{10pt}
So if you chance to meet him, when walking round the town\\
Just shake him by his fat old hand and give him half a crown\\
His eyes will beam and sparkle, he'll gurgle wth delight\\
And he'll start in laughing with all his blessed might.
