Magical Trevor is back once again\\
He's doing tricks that will drive you insane\\
How does he do them?\\
I wanna' know\\
Ahh!\\
He's got a magical toe!\\
Start of the gig\\
Here comes a pig\\
Look at Trev's toe\\
It's started to glow\\
What will the trick be?\\
Don't let that pig pee!\\
Oh my! What happened?\\
Trev's summoned the kraken\\
He's causing havok\\
If I'm not mistaken his face is a haddock\\
Cheer up pig. Don't you cry\\
