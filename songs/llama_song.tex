Here's a llama, there's a llama, and another little Llama\\
Fuzzy Llama, Funny Llama, llama llama duck\par

Llama, llama, cheesecake, llama, tablet, brick, potato llama, llama llama, mushroom llama, llama llama duck\par

I was once a treehouse, i lived in a cake,\\
though i never saw the way, the orange slayed the rake,\\
i was only three years dead, but it told a tale\\
and now listen, little child, to the safety rail\par
\vspace{10pt}
Have you ever seen a llama, kiss a llama, on a llama\\
llama's llama, tastes of llama, llama llama duck\par
\vspace{10pt}
half a llama, twice a llama, not a llama, farmer llama\\
llama in a car, alarm a llama llama duck\par
\vspace{10pt}
is it how it's told now? is it all so old?\\
is it made of lemon juice? doorknob, ankle, cold\\
now my song is getting thin, i've run out of luck!\\
time for me to retire now, and become a duck
