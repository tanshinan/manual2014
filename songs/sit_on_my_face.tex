Sit on my face and tell me that you love me\\
I'll sit on your face and tell you I love you too\\
I love to hear you oralize\\
When I'm between your thighs\\
You blow me away\\
\\
Sit on my face and let my lips embrace you\\
I'll sit on your face and then I'll love you truly\\
Life can be fine if we both sixty nine\\
If we sit on our faces in all sorts of places\\
And play till we're blown away
