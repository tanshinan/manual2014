\visa{I Can't Poop In Strange Places}

\par
I can't poop in strange places\\
(strange places)\\
I can only poop in my home\\
It's as though i'm watched by strange faces\\
(strange faces)\\
I'ts why I never roam\\
\\
I've left Stewie alone with strangers\\
(strangers)\\
To satisfy my fecal needs\\
I've put my whole family in danger\\
To poop before my anus bleeds\\
\\
Home bowl, home bowl\\
You know just what I need\\
Home bowl, home bowl\\
Poop before my anus bleeds
